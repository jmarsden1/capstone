            <p> My name is Jade, I am from Prince Rupert, BC. But have grown up in Vancouver.</p>
            <p> Along with travel, I love food, photography, and cats.</p>
            <p> Even <strong>more</strong> than that, I love when I can <em>combine</em> them.</p>

            <p> There are so many places to see! When I first started out I wasn't sure what to look for first.</p>
            <p> My first big solo trip was 10 years ago and these two sites were what helped me the most.</p>
            <p> <a href= "http://www.expedia.com"target="blank">Expedia</a> is easy to navigate and gives many options. </p>
            <p><a href= "http://www.airbnb.com" target="blank">Air bnb</a> Though there is some controversy around it, I have found some wonderful and unique homes to stay in!</p>
            
            <p> As for food? My favourite thing to do is wander the streets and see where the locals are!</p>

        <h2>What Have I Learned from Travel?</h2>
   It is not always what you expect. Missed flights, delayed trains, and lost passports are all part of the <em>fun</em>.

     <h2>Where would I like to go Next?</h2>
    At the top of my list now is to get to Asia. Japan and Korea! Primarily for the food, but of course for the beautiful scenary as well. Cherry Blossom season would be incredible!
